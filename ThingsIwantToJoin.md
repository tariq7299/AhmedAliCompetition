# Problems faces last time and there potentionl solution

**Lack of data entries individuals**
*Increase the number of data entries individuals*

**Lack of the Number of printers and computers**
*Increase printers and compouters*

**The method/file/tool that we used to collect athletes data is too chaiotic and inefficient**
*use better tool*

**There were no unique identifier which we can give each athlete found in the file/tool which we used to collect athlets inof ! so we find our slefels in a sitiuation were like there is multiple athlete come the next day and some of them have the same first and last name and no actual identifier to know the person !!!**
*Give each athlete a unique identifier in the day he enrolls in competition*

**sms and messages didn't got sent correctly and not all of the people got there message stating there competion time so we like want a better tool to send sms and whats app messages !**
*Find a better tool and also send via multi tool also make an announcement on social media*
*MAke sales call athletes and tell them about the competion*
*Take at least two phone numbers*


**No good preperation for the actual scenario and like doing  a prova to prepare and simulate the actual situation** 
*set a meeting of the it manager of competion*
*Do multi provas couple of days before the competition*

**No real time tracking of the athletes status (like if they compete of not!, did they win or not..etc)**
*Use a good tool to do that*

**a very bad tool we used to set the time of each category and trach each time of each category and like the when it will start when it will end and some other datisl ! like i want better tool**
